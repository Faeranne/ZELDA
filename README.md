## What is Z.E.L.D.A.?
Z.E.L.D.A stands for Zone Enabled Low cost Distributed Automation.  I will admit that it's a bit of a backronym, but it applies nonetheless.  the core tenants of the system are

* Distributed control - no single point of failure.
* Open Source - both hardware and software, as much as possible.
* Low cost components - 
* Low energy requirements - 
* Higly secure - encrypted communication over all wireless lines, protections against jamming, etc.
